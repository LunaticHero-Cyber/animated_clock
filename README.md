# Animated Clock

This is an animated clock that is created in a react native framework. The whole point of this project is literally JUST a clock. Trust me. Shows only a simple moving clock, that are moving according to the time.

## To run debug

### Step 1: Start metro

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

## To build the app

This is a way to create a APK so you can bring this "cute" clock anywhere (only android... for now)

#### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android:build
```
